# Health Card 🩺

A clean, responsive **health monitoring dashboard UI** built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project simulates a personal health tracker interface that visually presents key health metrics in a simple and user-friendly way.

⚠️ This is **not real diagnostic tool. It is a **front-end prototype** focused on UI/UX, layout, and data presentation.

## Overview

The Health Monitor project is designed to demonstrate how health-related data can be displayed clearly and intuitively in a web interface. It focuses on **visual clarity, responsiveness, and modern UI design**, rather than real sensor integration or medical accuracy.

All values are **static or simulated**, making this project ideal for:
- UI/UX demonstrations
- Front-end practice
- Dashboard layout experimentation
- Portfolio showcase

---

## Features

These values are shown in a **card-based layout** for easy scanning.

### Modern UI Design
- Clean and minimal layout
- Card-based components
- Smooth spacing and typography
- Designed for readability, not clutter

### Responsive Layout
- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- Uses Tailwind utility classes for flexible scaling
- No layout breaking on smaller screens

### Lightweight & Fast
- No frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- No backend
- No build tools
- Loads instantly in the browser

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure and layout
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling and responsiveness
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – UI behavior and interactions

No external JavaScript libraries are used.

---

## How It Works (Important)

- All health data is **hardcoded or simulated**
- There is **no real-time data collection**
- No APIs, sensors, or databases are involved
- The project focuses on **presentation**, not computation

If you claim otherwise, you’re lying — and anyone technical will notice.

## Project Goals

This project exists to:
- Practice dashboard-style UI design
- Learn Tailwind CSS utility workflows
- Improve layout structuring for data-heavy screens
- Build a realistic-looking health interface without backend
